# To-do List Web Application
A front-end development project that I started last year and decided to improve by adding additional features and reorganizing my code. The To-Do list web application is for everyday users that need a place to organize their busy lives.<br>
<br>

## Purpose
I'm developing a to-do list application because of its flexibility. It allows me to freely add or remove features, providing an ideal way to practice a wide range of essential programming skills. Moreover, I'm a firm believer in the organizational power of to-do lists. Therefore, this project is a perfect opportunity to apply theory directly and create a tool that aligns with my own productivity methods.


## Built using
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Node.js (Map API)

## Link
* Live Site URL: https://elliequispe.github.io/To-Do-List/
  
## The Challenge
* Ensuring synchronization of category names saved in localStorage with those available in the form.
* Dynamically updating the date as the user navigates to a future or past date.
* Implementing accurate form validation, considering varying requirements for different input fields and buttons, and managing error messages when users insert values.
* Maintaining accurate tracking of the status of each checkbox.

## Future Enhancements
* Incorporate a time entry option to make the "Upcoming" tab functional.
* Implement weekly and monthly calendar views to enhance overall planning.
* Develop a responsive mobile version to ensure accessibility across different devices.
